Personal Portfolio Website: Tech Stack & AI Prompt Guide

1. Recommended Tech Stack

Based on your requirements, here is the optimal tech stack:

Core Framework: React (with TypeScript)

Why: React is the industry standard. It allows you to modularize your "Projects," "Skills," and "Services" into reusable components. Using TypeScript ensures your code is robust and less prone to errors, which is great to show off in a portfolio code review.

Alternative: If you want absolute simplicity and don't plan on complex interactivity, HTML/CSS/JavaScript is fine. However, React is much better for showcasing "employable" skills.

Styling: Tailwind CSS

Why: It speeds up development significantly. You can make the site responsive (mobile-friendly) just by adding utility classes (e.g., md:flex-row). It looks clean and modern out of the box.

Icons: Lucide React or FontAwesome

Why: You need consistent icons for your social media and contact info.

Animations: Framer Motion

Why: Portfolios need a "wow" factor. Framer Motion makes it easy to add fade-ins and smooth scrolling without complex CSS keyframes.
